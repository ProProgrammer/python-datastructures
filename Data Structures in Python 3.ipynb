    "**Linked Lists**\n",
    "- Linked lists are data structures consisting of nodes\n",
    "- Each node has some value and a pointer to the next node in the linked list\n",
    "- Advantage: Often compared to arrays but arrays consume block of memory from the get go (as you have to define an array at the start) while Linked lists do not consume block of memory and they can grow on need basis\n",
    "- Disadvantage: Arrays have constant lookup time because at any point you can literally get anything in the array by its index, however Linked Lists have linear look up time O(n), which means, you have to traverse through the list and check for the value in each node of linked list and if the value does not match to what you are looking for, take the pointer to the next node in the list and then go to that node and check for value there and keep doing until you find the node that has the value that you wanted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Study Advise:**\n",
    "- While Linked lists might not be very popular in dynamic langauges like Python, Ruby, etc. knowledge of how they work internally is helpful since very often there are several data structures that internally use Linked Lists for their implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- INFO: Several front-end frameworks too use linked lists, stacks, etc. which are not very common data structures if you think of dynamic languages"
